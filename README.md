Deploying a Cloud Native App Using Docker and Kubernetes v3.1

Welcome to Cisco Live San Diego 2019!

Thanks for attending this lab. The goal is to show you the basics operations and concepts of Kubernetes and Docker to create a cloud-native application. I will take you step by step in the process to install Kubernetes, Minikube with integrated Docker and Kubectl, create, deploy and scale your kubernetes pods and deployments.

You will be able to replicate this lab at home at your own pace and get experience with Kubernetes!

Enjoy and thanks for attending
