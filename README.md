# CLUS19-LTRPRG-1200
Deploying a Cloud Native App Using Docker and Kubernetes v3.1

Welcome to Cisco Live San Diego 2019!

Thanks for attending this lab. The goal is to show you the basics operations and concepts of Kubernetes and Docker to create a cloud-native application. I will take you step by step in the process to install Kubernetes, Minikube with integrated Docker and Kubectl, create, deploy and scale your kubernetes pods and deployments.

In this branch you will get the updated Lab Guide with a strong focus on Windows, however, you can use the same commands for Linux or Mac OSX. There are couple of additional files: a minikube shell to uninstall Minikube and Kubectl from Linux (useful if you use dCloud) and a example of a simple pod deployment for Kubernetes and Docker.

The guide has been written to go over enough details so you will have most of the instructions there to walk over the 6 different labs and the do-it-your-own lab plus an additional lab to play with Minikube applications.

Please provide me feedback and if you find any error.

You will be able to replicate this lab at home at your own pace and get experience with Kubernetes!

Enjoy and thanks for attending
